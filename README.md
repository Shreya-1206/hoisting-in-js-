# Hoisting in jsðŸ˜„

## We know that in memory phase the variables are allocated with special value undefined.

### In hoisting.js we trying to access getName() and x before intialization or put some value in x and that gives us undefined. And yeah so x would be undefined and getName would give us the console directly because in memory phase the function are fully copied.... 

### Therefore , hoisting in js means trying access some vairables or functions before intialization .... 


## But if we use getName as arrow function with a variable name it will give us an error saying getName is not a function and same goes with variable named function...
